Utility - Credits to Fred;

Holder is the txtFile

you can either choose to read in from Text file or uncomment the 3rd line on main,
which will load in the default names from the program. The file contains 
edited names already.

When program pops up menu will be shown, chose 7 for assignment page or 6 to exit

1-5 will Add/update/writeFile(emergencyOnly)/ReadFile;

Program is still easily breakable without the use of tryparsing my inputs.



Hope you enjoy my 6th assignment!
